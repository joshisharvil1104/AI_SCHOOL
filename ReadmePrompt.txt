We want to start a new MEAN stack application project from scratch. The purpose of the application is to help schools teach AI to students. The system should support two types of users: teachers and students.

The application will include:
	•	Separate login flows for teachers and students.
	•	Role-based access:
	•	Teachers have unrestricted access to AI tools and teaching dashboards.
	•	Students have restricted access to the AI functionality (e.g., daily limits, specific prompt categories, etc.).

We want to:
	•	Use a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).
	•	Start with backend development first, then move to UI (Angular).
	•	Keep the UI simple and minimal, especially in the first phase.
	•	Use GitHub for source control, with multiple branches for each feature/task.
	•	Follow agile methodology, dividing the project into very small, weekly, doable user stories/tasks.
	•	Document all phases clearly.
	•	Integrate a free AI API (suggest the most suitable one such as OpenAI, Cohere, etc.), with the ability to upgrade to a paid/pro version later.

Now, based on the above, create a full detailed development blueprint document that includes:
	1.	Project Overview
	2.	Goals and Objectives
	3.	Suggested Tech Stack
	4.	System Architecture Diagram (Text Description is OK)
	5.	Backend Module Breakdown
	6.	Frontend Module Breakdown
	7.	Authentication and Role Management Design
	8.	AI API Integration Strategy (start with free tier, explain how to upgrade later)
	9.	Data Models and Schemas
	10.	Access Control Rules (RBAC)
	11.	Agile Development Strategy
	•	Weekly sprints
	•	Epics and stories for MVP
	•	Sample sprint board layout
	•	Suggested branching model (e.g., main, dev, feature/*, bugfix/*)
	12.	Deployment Plan (initially on free tier platforms like Render/Heroku/Vercel, then how to migrate to scalable infra)
	13.	Future Roadmap and Scalability Plans
	14.	Security Practices
	15.	Contribution Guidelines for GitHub
	16.	Testing Strategy (Unit, Integration, E2E)
	17.	Basic CI/CD pipeline suggestion

Make sure the final document is:
	•	Structured like a real software architecture/design document.
	•	Easy to read, with bullet points and headings.
	•	Usable directly on GitHub as a README or project documentation.
	•	Includes actionable steps so that developers can pick up work immediately.
	•	Modular so we can expand it sprint by sprint.
